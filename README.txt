This is a python script for generating 35 tests with 50 questions each. Each is a multiple choice question asking the student to select, from a list, the correct state capital. Each quiz is distinct from any other and also contains it's own answer key. I have also created a script to automatically grade the completed quizzes, in case someone wants to use that. Simply run it once on it's own, or create the "ungraded" folder on it's own and place the completed, ungraded quizzes in the folder. Once that's done, it will prompt you to enter the name of the file which you would like to grade, and then produce a report showing you every question the student got wrong, as well as the percentage and final grade.

While I took the project idea from the book, all the code I've used is my own.
